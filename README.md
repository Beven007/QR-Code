This project is based on an optimized warehouse inventory management system utilizing UAV formations and QR code scanning. 

The experiments are conducted in the simulation environment available at https://github.com/HuangJiaqi-MISE/MAPFame-UAV.

All experiments in this study were conducted on a server equipped with an RTX 3080 Ti (12 GB), 12 vCPUs (Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4214R CPU @ 2.40 GHz), and 90 GB of RAM. The experimental environment included Python 3.8.3, NumPy 1.24.1, OpenCV-Python 4.10.0.84, Pyzbar 0.1.9, and DBR 9.6.40.2. During the experimentation process, all code was written and tested on the server.
